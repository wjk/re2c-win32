# re2c-win32

This is the `re2c` parser generator compiler, version 0.14.3, patched to
compile cleanly on Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2015. Both the `re2c`
application and the `libre2c` client library are provided.

`re2c` and `libre2c` have been committed to the Public Domain by their
original authors, Peter Bumbulis, Dan Nuffer, Marcus Boerger, and
Hartmut Kaiser.
