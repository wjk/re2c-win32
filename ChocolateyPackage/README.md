# Chocolatey Package

This directory contains the source for a [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package
for `re2c`. The package contains the `re2c` executable directly; it is copied from the
Visual Studio Release build output directory. You can use the `create-package.bat`
script to automate this process.
